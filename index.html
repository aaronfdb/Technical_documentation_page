    <p>Python is a programming language that can be easy to pick up whether you're a first time programmer or you're experienced with other languages.Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>
    <p>Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>

    <p>A string is one of several data types that exist within the Python language. A data type, as the name implies, is a category that a particular type of data fits into, Every type of data you enter into a computer is segregated into one of these data types, whether they be numbers or letters, as is the case in this scenario. Giving data a type allows the computer to determine how to handle the data. For instance, if you want the program to show the mathematical equation 1+1 on a screen, you have to tell it that it is text. Otherwise, the program will interpret the data as a mathematical equation and evaluate it accordingly.</p>
    <p>A string is a data type that consists of any character, be it a letter, number, symbol, or punctuation mark. Therefore, the following are all examples of strings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Hello, how are you?”</li>
        <li>“1 + 1”</li>
        <li>“I ate 4 bananas”</li>
        <li>“!@#$%^&*()”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you type a string into Python, you do so by preceding it with quotes.</p>

		<header>Numbers and Operators</header>
    <p>Python offers three different kinds of numbers with which you can work: integers, floating-point numbers (or floats), and imaginary numbers.</p>
    <p>In the Python shell, you can enter different numbers and see what type tells you about how Python sees them:</p>
    <code>
      >>> type(1)<br>
      class ‘int’<br>
      >>> type(2000)<br>
      class ‘int’<br>
      >>> type(999999999999)<br>
      class ‘int’<br>
      >>> type(1.0)<br>
      class ‘float’
       </code>
    <p>Although in everyday life 1.0 is the same number as 1, Python will automatically perceive 1.0 as being a float; without the .0, the number 1 would be dealt with as the integer number one, which is a different kind of number.</p>
    <p>In essence, the special distinction between a float and an integer is that a float has a component that is a fraction of 1. Numbers such as 1.01, 2.34, 0.02324 and any other number that contains a fractional component is treated as a floating-point number.</p>
    <p>The last type of number that Python offers is oriented toward engineers and mathematicians. It’s the imaginary number. It’s defined as the square root of -1. Despite being named imaginary, it does have a lot of practical uses in modelling real-world engineering situations, as well as in other disciplines like physics and pure math. The imaginary number is built into Python so that it’s easily usable by user communities who frequently need to solve their problems with computers.</p>
    <p>The imaginary number behaves very much like a float, except that it cannot be mixed with a float. When you see an imaginary number, it will have the letter j trailing it:</p>
    <code>
      >>> 12j<br>
      12j
    </code>
    <p>When you use the letter j next to a number and outside the context of a string (that is, not enclosed in quotes), Python knows that you’ve asked it to treat the number you’ve just entered as an imaginary number. When any letter appears outside of a string, it has to have a special meaning, such as this modifier, which specifies the type of number, or a named variable, or another special name. Otherwise, the appearance of a letter by itself will cause an error!</p>
    <p>You can combine imaginary and nonimaginary numbers to create complex numbers:</p>
    <code>
      >>> 12j + 1<br>
      (1+12j)<br>
      >>> 12j + 1.01<br>
      (1.01+12j)<br>
      >>> type (12j - 1)<br>
      class ‘complex’<br>
    </code>
    <p>You can enter basic arithmetic at the Python shell prompt and use it like a calculator. Like a calculator, Python will accept a set of operations, and when you press the Enter key, it will evaluate everything you’ve typed and give you your answer:</p>
    <code>
      >>> 5 + 300<br>
      305<br>
      6876<br>
      >>> 40 – 20<br>
      20<br>
      >>> 4023 – 22.46<br>
      4000.54<br>
      >>>50 / 5<br>
      10<br>
      >>> 10 * 2<br>
      20
    </code>

		<header>Variables</header>
    <p>It’s difficult to always write strings and numbers explicitly throughout a program because it forces you to remember everything. The exacting memory that computers have enable them to remember far more details than people can, and taking advantage of that capability is a huge part of programming. However, to make using data more flexible and easy, you want to give the data names that can be used to refer to them.</p>
    <p>These names are commonly called variables, which indicates that the data to which they refer can vary (it can be changed), while the name remains the same. The below are examples of variables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>first_string = “This is a string”</li>
      <li>second_string = “This is another string”</li>
      <li>first_number = 4</li>
      <li>second_number = 5</li>
    </ul>
	</section>
  <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
		<header>If...else statement</header>
    <p>Python has a very simple way of letting you make decisions. The reserved word for decision making is if, and it is followed by a test for the truth of a condition, and the test is ended with a colon.  It can be used with anything that evaluates to True or False to say “if something is true, do what follows”.</p>
    <code>
    >>> if 1 > 2:<br>
    print(“No it is not!”)<br>
    >>> if 2 > 1:<br>
    print(“Yes it is!”)
    </code>
    <p>You can create a chain of tests beginning with if … : using elif … :. elif … : enables a variety of conditions to be tested for but only if a prior condition wasn’t met. If you use a series of if … : statements they will all be executed. If you use an if … : followed by an elif … :, the elif … : will be evaluated only if the if … : results in a False value:</p>
    <code>
      >>> milk_price = 1.50<br>
      >>> if milk_price < 1.25<br>
      print(“Buy two cartons of milk, they’re on sale”)<br>
      elif milk_price < 2.00<br>
      print(“Buy one carton of milk, prices are normal”)<br>
      elif milk_price > 2.00<br>
      print(“Go somewhere else! Milk costs too much here”)
    </code>
    <p>There is also a fall-through statement that you can insert to handle those cases where none of the prior tests resulted in a True value: the else: statement. If none of the if … : or elif … : statements have test conditions that evaluate to True, the else: clause is invoked:</p>
    <code>
      >>> OJ_price = 2.50<br>
      >>> if OJ_price < 1.25<br>
      print(“Get one, I’m thirsty.”)<br>
      elif OJ_price <= 2.00<br>
      print(“Ummm… sure, but I’ll drink it slowly.”)<br>
      else<br>
      print(“I don’t have enough money. Never mind.”)
    </code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="functions">
		<header>Functions</header>
    <p>A function in Python (and every other programming language) is a tool developers use to save time and make their programs more efficient. Instead of writing the same code over and over again, they store it in a function, and then call upon that function when they need it.</p>
    <p>The print() function is used whenever you want to print text to the screen:</p>
    <code>
      >>> print (“Hello World!”)
    </code>
    <p>When you press Enter, you should see the following:</p>
    <code>
      Hello World!
    </code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="classes_and_objects">
		<header>Classes and Objects</header>
    <p>In Python, every piece of data you see or come into contact with is represented by an object. Each of these objects has three components: an identity, a type, and a value. The identity represents the location of the object being held in your memory (and therefore is unchangeable), while its type tells us what types of data and values it can have. The value, meanwhile, can be changed in an object, but only if it is set as a mutable type; if it is set as immutable, then it may not change.</p>
    <code>
      >>> omelet_type = “Cheese”:1 “Ham”:2
    </code>
    <p>After you have an object bound to a name, using that name provides you with access to all of the data and functions you’ve defined. When you are writing code for a class, you start by declaring that class. You do this with the class keyword.</p>
    <p>The definition of a class is simple and mainly involves the use of the special word class along with a name.</p>
    <code>
      class Fridge<br>
      >>> f = Fridge ({“eggs”:6, “milk”:4, “cheese”:3})<br>
      >>> if f.has (“cheese”, 2):<br>
      …	print(“It’s time to make an omelet!”)
    </code>
